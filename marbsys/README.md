# Notes:
I found no need for vacation type object, maybe i didn't get the idea behind it.

i think no need for authentication system or adding security layer as this is just a test.

it doesn't make sense that the system allow for 1 day vacation request and there is a vacation_from and vacation_to. i handeled it as request in the RUlES.
